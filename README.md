### Contribution guidelines ###

* Code follows personal coding conventions/structure which is subject to change however I try to maintain the following:
  - Variable names are in lower camel case ( variableName ).
  - Method names are in upper camel case ( MethodName ).
  - Class names are in upper camel case ( ClassName ).
  - In longer classes, variables are defined close to where they're first used.
  - Subclasses almost always have all variables defined at the top of the class.
