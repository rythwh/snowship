### What is this repository for? ###

* Snowship is a colony survival management simulation game developed by Esteae/Ryan White.
* Snowship Alpha R1

### How do I get set up? ###

* Clone the repository into a directory and open with an updated version of Unity3D.
* No configuration necessary.
* No dependencies.
* No database.
* Unit tests will be implemented in the Tests.cs file within the game's scripts.
  These tests can be run anywhere in the game by referencing Tests.cs and running the appropriate test function
  once it is created.
* To deploy/build the game, build it using Unity's build tool, place it in a ZIP folder and upload it to itch.io.
  itch.io Refinery will be utilized in the future.

### Contribution guidelines ###

* The contents of a test should reflect the nature of the function that is being tested.
  The output of the tests can either be to the Unity console or to an external log file.
* Code follows personal coding conventions/structure which is subject to change however I will try to maintain the following:
  - Variable names are camelCase.
  - Function/method names are UppercaseByWord.
  - Methods in a script are usually called in order by a master-method located somewhere in the script which is itself called by a master-method for the game itself.
* No other guidelines.
